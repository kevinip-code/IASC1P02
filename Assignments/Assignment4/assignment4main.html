<h2>About the Design</h2>
    <p>
I have chosen this design as a way to provide a simplistic user interface with everything available to you at a glance. Each of the elements are centered in the middle of the screen for the comfort of the user. The colors are varying shades of grey which were chosen to create a clean and sophisticated look and feel. The home page and design page were made to look exactly the same in order to have consistent repeating visual elements for familiarity and organization. How I chose these colors was based on the following C.R.A.P design found on <a href="https://elearningindustry.com/using-crap-web-design-for-elearning">eLearning Industry</a>

  1. Contrast
Contrast is often the most important visual technique affecting what appears on screen. By applying a little contrast in the right places you can avoid elements on the page that are merely similar:

making different things different
making the important elements stand out
muting less important elements
creating a bit of dynamism on the screen.
Here are a some of the screen elements that you should look at providing  contrasting to:

Sizes
Colours
Fonts
Line thickness
Location of blocks or elements on the screen (e.g. text blocks)
Spacing between elements
Shapes
Titles, body text, bold text and underlining help to organise information, make it meaningful and memorable and provide direction or instruction for your learners. The use of bold or italic text is one common form of contrast — the difference in shape makes the bolded or italicized text stand out from the surrounding text. This is a great example from Utility Warehouse of strong visual design with bold contemporary contrasting colours.

2. Repetition
Web designers repeat visual elements of their design throughout the site. Elements such as colour, shape, texture, spatial relationships, line thicknesses, sizes, can all be repeated to help develop a sense of organisation, unity and consistency.

By repeating design elements on the screen such as titles, layout, colour schemes and so on, you provide visual cues to your leaner so that they’re able to follow the course content and understand how it all fits together.

Some elearning authoring tool allow you to build templates that you can reuse for various page types, making it quicker and easier to set up these designs once and then use them consistently over and over. Some authoring tools provide ready made ‘themes’ which have already been set up to adhere to the very best elearning and web design practices.

Templates and themes allow you to standardise repeated screen types such as:

Introductions
Scenarios
Screens with media (images, audio, video)
Interactions
Summaries
Quiz instructions
Quiz screens

3. Alignment
Nothing should be placed on screen in an arbitrary way. Every element should have some visual connection with another element. This creates a clean, clear and sophisticated took and feel. Aligning your screen elements creates a visual flow and visually connects the screen. This example from Make Sense Design of a one-page design demonstrates the principle of alignment well.

You should be asking yourself constantly: Does everything line up or have you got things centred, left aligned or out of place?

4. Proximity
Proximity on the screen provides a critical cue about whether items are or are not related. Elements that are related need to be grouped close together. When several elements are in close proximity to each other, they become one visual unit rather than several separate units. This helps you organise information, reduces clutter and gives your learner visual clues to help them understand the meaning of what’s being conveyed. You should be asking yourself constantly: Can you find everything you need on your page easily? What is it that your learners will take note of?
