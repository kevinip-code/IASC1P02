<h2>Company story/background/products</h2>
    <p>
Rationale: Currently the banner has too many colors and is too cluttered with words and items. The size of the font is inconsistent with different words being bolded and hyperlinked to sources to show importance, however looks unprofessional contrary to the message it is trying to portray, which is about the effective and reliability of their products. There are way too many categories with even more drop-down menus that lead to completely different websites. The Content is very bland and unattractive to look at and inconsistent alignment, with again, too many hyperlinks. The font is too small with too many words that is not a simple nor effective way to sell a product. The search bar is not a search bar, but rather a link to another portion of their site. Not a friendly user interface; no pictures or helpful tools to help guide you through the site. The site gives the impression of what a clean website would look like with very minimal features, yet very messy with being crowded with text and links. Overall, the site appears to be very outdated and reminiscent of what an unsafe or scam website would look like.
